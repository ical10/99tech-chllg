# Problem 1: Sum to N

Three different implementations of sum to n algorithms.

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests in the project
pnpm test

# Run only problem1 tests
pnpm test:problem1

# Run tests in watch mode
pnpm test:watch
```

## Test Coverage

The test suite covers:
- Edge case: n = 0
- Base case: n = 1
- Small values: n = 5, n = 10
- Large values: n = 100
- Error handling: negative numbers
